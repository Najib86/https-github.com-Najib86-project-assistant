o   List of Abbreviations (if applicable)

**Chapter One: Introduction**

**1.1
****Background to the Study**

Here, the students describes in general terms, the
larger area of the problem being investigated.
This forms the basis for introducing the problem, as well as a way of
establishing the relationship that exists between the problem being
investigated and the larger area of concern to people and organizations.

**1.2
****Statement of the Problem**

The essence of research is to identify problems and
proffer solutions for them.  Students
should be able to state the problems clearly and convincingly, justifying the
need to find solutions to it, as well as the implication of such problems.  A research problem could be linked to a given
theory or fact.

**1.3
****Research Questions**

Research questions help the student to generate answers
to the problem being investigated.  Such
research questions should correspond with the aim and objectives of the
study.  When the research questions are
answered, the objectives of the study are achieved.  From the general research questions, minor
research questions can be formulated.  These
are specific questions which may be used eventually for constructing  the questionnaire or research instrument.  The major research questions should be raised
using active verbs such as *are, is, does
etc. E.g “Are youths who watch violent TV
programmes more * *vulnerable to media Violence than those who
watch non-violent programmes?” * This
will subsequently reinforce both the validity and the reliability of the
instrument.

**1.4
****Aims
and Objectives**

The
author is expected to state the overall goal of the project, which encapsulates
the aim.  The purpose of the study is to
be given as finding a solution to the problem or examining the relationships
that exist between that particular problem and other problems.  This is by breaking the problem into its
component parts through exploration or analysis.  Four (4) to five (5) specific statements
(objectives) of what the research intends to do to achieve the main aim could
be stated. E.g. One of the objectives could read “To identify the amount of exposure of
youths to violent messages on television”.

**1.5       Hypotheses**

These are tentative statements of relationships
between two or more variables.  They
carry statements about relationships between variables to be proved right or
wrong.  Hypotheses also guide the
researcher in his quest for data.  This could
be derived from **the existing literature
or the response questions.**

**1.6       Significance**

The significance ordinarily should consist of both the
theoretical and practical importance of the study.  It provides the author the opportunity to
dissect the existing theoretical literature and add, modify or debunk existing
theories in that field.  It provides the
author the opportunity to justify his/her attempt to solve the problem and
essentially state what  will be
contributed to knowledge by the study if successfully carried out.

**1.7       Scope
of the Study**

This means delimiting the boundaries of the research so
as to present his research within a manageable limit.  This limitation could be as a result of
conceptual reasons or constraints arising from finance, time and data
availability, etc.

**1.8       Definition
of Concepts/Operationalisation**

The student is encouraged to do a clarification of  the concepts used in  specific ways in the study.  Sometimes, this clarification of concept is
referred to as the “operational definition of concepts.”  This is necessary to avoid ambiguity in the
study.

**NB:**
Due to professional considerations introductions and summaries could be allowed
in            each
chapter of the project.

**Chapter Two:  Literature Review**

The
Literature Review is a comprehensive survey of existing literature in the area
of survey.  Sometimes the literature
review covers 3 (three) main aspects: conceptual issues, theoretical framework
and presentation of empirical studies.
However, there is also a sense in which the literature review peruses
the existing literature with respect to the key research questions raised.  This is to ascertain the quantity and quality
of the work done in the area and possible areas of intervention.   Literature review could also be approached
thematically or by examining the works of authors in the chosen areas.  The literature review must seek to present
works already carried out which are relevant to the central questions raised in
the research.

**Guidelines for literature review **

Brief
explanation of the work to be done.  E.g.
this chapter looks at the various works done in this direction.  It could be done under the following
headlines:

2.1       Conceptual
Literature/ or Thematic Concerns:

    Under this heading, the key words
or variables in the research title should be discussed.

2.2       Theoretical framework of the study

Relevant theories to the problem being investigated in
the study should be briefly discussed and linked to the study to provide the
right framework for the study i.e. theories on which the study is
anchored.  It also provides an avenue for
reviewing relevant and known literature to the problem being investigated.

**2.3       **Empirical study / works done by different authors

This provides the researcher the opportunity to review
some of the previous works by other authors in this area of concern.  A brief historical background will enable the
researcher to follow the trend of thought in this area.  This will enable or help the researcher
situate or relate his study to previous works done in the area of concern.

**Chapter Three: Research Method**

Research
Methodology implies the different procedures that could be used in the prosecution
of the study which may involve different research designs.

3.1       Preamble:
A brief introduction of the research design of interest to the researcher and
the justification for his choice.  Also a
summary of the views of some of the authors who have discussed that particular
research design.

3.2       Research Design

This has to do with the blueprint of the study that
point to what should be expected.  It
shows the particular research design being adopted for the study and why e.g.
survey, content analysis, historical, experimental, etc.  It equally states whether it is a qualitative
or quantitative study or a triangulation of both.

3.3       Population of the Study

This has to do with the characteristics of the
population of the study. i.e. the total elements of the universe covered by the
study.  The population of the study is a
consensus phenomenon, being investigated or studied.  This should be indicated with verifiable
references.  The nature of the study population
must be known because it helps in the choice of sampling technique.  A study population could be individual,
books, animals, etc.

3.4       Sampling and Sample size

The sample is part of the population or representative
part of the population.  Before drawing
the sample, the researcher must define what the unit of analysis or unit of
study is, that is, what or who is being studied and what constitutes the
population from which the sample will be drawn.
The manner of selecting the sample is as important as the size of the
sample.  The size of the sample is the
number of the population elements that are selected for study.

3.5       Data Collection Instrument and Validation

Validity is concerned with the instrument measuring
what it is suppose to measure while reliability is concerned with the
constituency obtained from results of the application of the instrument.  An instrument may be reliable without being
valid.  It is important that the
researcher should subject the instrument to the test of validity and
reliability.The instrument could be validated  by **pretesting**
it on a group of people that have the same characteristics with the  population of
the study.  Only data which have
relevance to the theory in respect of the current study should be collected.

3.6       Techniques of Data Analysis

These include data preparation, tabulation and
analysis.  It should state how the
quantitative information gathered through the research will be presented.   The procedure for summarizing and exploring
relationships among the variables on which data have been collected is required
also.  For example, *single variable analysis *or one variable at a time (*univariate analysis)* which is often done
for descriptive purpose – frequency distribution by grouping the data; useful
summary through some measure of dispersion such as range, variance and standard
deviation.  Relationships involving *more than one variable (multivariate
analysis) *such as regression models, correlational analysis, analysis of
variance, t-test, factor analysis, and discriminant analysis. The student may
also use computer programmes such as Statistical Packages for Social Sciences
(SPSS).  Students will have to choose the
methods that best suits the data collected as well as justify the choice of the
methods.  This gives the possible
relationship that might exist among the key variables of the study; and thus
make easier the actual analysis.

3.7       Limitations of Methodology

Selected research designs have advantages and
limitations.  These could be extraneous
circumstances with the sampling and the design itself and it is important that
whatever limitation is experienced should be mentioned.

**Chapter Four: Data Presentation and
Analysis**

4.1       Preamble

A brief outline of the chapter to provide insight into
the content of the chapter.  Also include
the background of the respondents.

4.2       Presentation and Analysis of Data
According to Research Questions

Data could be presented using tables, pie charts, bar
charts, histograms, etc, this is at the nominal levels of analysis.  Data collected are to be presented and
analyzed.  Students will have to choose
the methods that best suites the data collected.  Data presented should be accompanied with the
interpretation of the associations and relationships among the data groups with
the appropriate implication to the study.
The summary of interpretation should provide answers to the research
questions.

4.3       Test of Hypotheses

Relevant data collected and tables, where necessary,
could be used to test the stated hypotheses showing how they test the hypotheses
one after the other at relevant levels of significance as well as the relevant
interpretation and avoiding types of errors i.e. type I or type II errors.

At this level, the student is expected to use information
obtained from the analyses of the hypotheses earlier raised.  Majorly in respect to the validation or
non-validation of the hypotheses.

4.4       Discussion on Findings

Discourse your findings and proffer the implications
of the study, both for the discipline and the
under-society.

**Chapter Five: Summary, Conclusion and
Recommendation**

5.1       Summary

A brief summary or highlights of each chapter should
be stated in a concise manner that captures the importance of the study

5.2       Conclusion

    Conclusions should be drawn from the
findings.

5.3       Recommendations

    Recommendations should also be based
on the conclusions
